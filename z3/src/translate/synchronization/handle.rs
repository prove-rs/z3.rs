/// A fully thread-safe wrapper for Z3 structures (other than [`Context`]).
///
/// This wrapper
/// takes in a Z3 type (or a user-defined type that uses Z3 types) and translates its contents
/// into a private "singleton" [`Context`]. Since this [`Context`] is unused elsewhere, it is safe
/// to [`Send`] it and its contents to other threads AND to have [`Sync`] accesses across threads.
/// The safety of the [`Send`] impl is upheld by construction, as all data associated with the inner
/// [`Context`] is guaranteed to be moved with it.
/// The safety of the [`Sync`] impl is upheld through an inner [`Mutex`].
///
/// Inner data can only be accessed through [`Synchronized::recover`], which translates the contents
/// for the given [`Context`].
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Initializing this type (usually done through
/// [`PrepareSynchronized::synchronized`](crate::PrepareSynchronized::synchronized))
/// will allocate
/// a new [`Context`] and [`Translate`] the provided `T` into it. This involves a non-zero amount of
/// overhead; if you are creating thousands of [`Synchronized`], you will see a performance impact.
///
/// If you need to move/reference a collection of data between threads, consider putting it in
/// a [`Vec`], which also implements [`PrepareSynchronized`](crate::PrepareSynchronized), and will
/// only create one [`Context`]. You can also implement [`Translate`] on your own types, which
/// will then inherit from a blanket impl of [`PrepareSynchronized`](crate::PrepareSynchronized)
/// for [`Translate`].
///
/// Note that this will only alleviate the overhead of
/// allocating many [`Context`]s. There is still some unavoidable overhead:
/// * A [`Context`] must  be allocated.
/// * Your `T` must be [`Translate`]'d into the [`Context`].
/// * The data inside [`Synchronized`] must be [`Translate`]'d out to be used.
///
/// Z3 translation scales in proportion to the complexity of the statement; if you use this with
/// some very complex set of formulas, expect it to take longer.
