### Finding Z3 Libraries

**Note:** This library has a dependency on Z3.

There are 3 ways for this crate to currently find Z3:

* By default, it will look for a system-installed copy of Z3.
  On Linux, this would be via the package manager. On macOS, this
  might be via Homebrew (`brew install z3`).
* Enabling the `bundled` feature will use `cmake` to build a
  locally bundled copy of Z3. This copy is provided via a git
  submodule within the repository.
* Enabling the `vcpkg` feature will use `vcpkg` to build and
  install a copy of Z3 which is then used.

**Note:** This crate requires a `z3.h` during build time.

* By default, the crate will look for a `z3.h` in standard/system
  include paths. The `Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER` environment variable can
  also be used to customize this.
* Enabling the`bundled` feature will cause the bundled copy of `z3.h`
  to be used. The `Z3_SYS_Z3_HEADER` environment variable can also
  be used to customize this.
* Enabling the `vcpkg` feature will cause the copy of `z3.h` provided
  by that version to be used. In this case, there is no override
  via the environment variable.
  Please note that [vcpkg-rs](https://docs.rs/vcpkg-rs) uses `*-windows-static-md` on Windows platform by default.

## Support and Maintenance

I am developing this library largely on my own so far. I am able
to offer support and maintenance, but would very much appreciate
donations via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/endoli). I can also
provide commercial support, so feel free to
